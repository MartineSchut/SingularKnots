# SingularKnots
Code related to "Two invariants for singular knots and tangles"
- Singular_Knots_sec2 is related to sec. 2 of the paper, about a fast way to compute the Singular Alexander polynomial called the Gamma calculus.
- Singular_Knots_sec3 is related to sec. 3 of the paper, about an improved invariant originating from a perturbed Alexander, that distinguishes more knots.

We modified the non-singular code provided by Dror Bar-Natan to include singular knots and tangles and suit our own conventions.
For the original non-singular code, please see Dror's website: http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/.
